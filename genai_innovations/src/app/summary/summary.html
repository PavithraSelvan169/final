    <p>Adoption of AI agents is accelerating, following a trajectory similar to generative AI.
      Currently, 14% of organizations have implemented AI agents at partial or full scale,
      while 23% are running pilot projects. Competitive momentum is strong, as 93% of leaders
      believe that scaling AI agents successfully within the next 12 months will provide a
      competitive edge. Near-term adoption is expected to be most extensive in customer service,
      IT, and sales functions. However, expectations for high autonomy are constrained; only 15%
      of all business processes are expected to operate at Level 3 (semi-autonomous) or higher
      autonomy in the next 12 months.</p>

<h2>Implementation Strategy of AI Agents</h2>

  <div class="summary">
    <p>Fewer than one in five organizations (16%) have a strategy and roadmap fully in
      place for implementing agentic AI initiatives. However, adoption momentum is increasing, as
      28% of organizations are currently formulating a strategy, and 39% have multiple uncoordinated
      initiatives underway. Organizations developing strategies prioritize defining clear business cases,
      establishing appropriate levels of autonomy, ensuring robust data management and protection, and
      planning for scalability across business functions. Successfully harnessing AI agents requires
      organizations to move beyond the hype by strengthening technological and data foundations,
      redesigning processes, and striking the right balance between agent autonomy and human involvement.</p>
