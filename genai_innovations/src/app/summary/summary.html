    <p>More than one in three organizations are already piloting or implementing AI agents,
highlighting strong momentum toward agent-based systems. Currently, 23% are running
pilot use cases, while 14% have progressed to partial or full-scale implementation.
Another 30% have started exploring AI agent potential, and 31% are preparing to
experiment or deploy within the next six to twelve months. Only 1% are not interested
in exploring AI agents, showing very low resistance to adoption. Compared to last year,
the number of organizations using AI agents has grown significantly, indicating rapidly
increasing maturity and interest across industries.</p>
