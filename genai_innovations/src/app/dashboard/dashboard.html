    <h3>Summary – Renewable Energy</h3>
    <p>
        Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are rapidly replacing
        fossil-fuel generation around the world. Technological improvements
        and falling costs have transformed renewables into the most
        cost-effective new sources of electricity in many regions. Large-scale
        investments in infrastructure, battery storage, and grid modernization
        now enable better integration of variable energy sources into national
        grids. Solar capacity has grown exponentially due to affordable panels
        and improved efficiency. Wind energy, both onshore and offshore, has
        expanded with more powerful turbines capturing energy at greater
        heights. Together, these sources significantly reduce carbon emissions,
        improve air quality, and lessen dependence on fossil fuels. Governments
        and private sectors are increasingly focused on achieving net-zero
        targets by expanding renewable capacity. Continued research into
        hydrogen, battery innovation, and smart-grid technologies will
        accelerate the global transition toward clean, sustainable energy.

    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
    <p>
        This application uses Angular 21 as a fully standalone SPA with route guards
        and JWT-based authentication handled through a FastAPI backend. The backend
        provides hardcoded test credentials and dynamic REST endpoints serving JSON
        chart data. An HTTP interceptor attaches JWT tokens automatically to requests.
        The frontend uses Chart.js via Ng2-Charts to visualize asynchronous data.
        Angular’s standalone architecture minimizes boilerplate and improves modularity.
