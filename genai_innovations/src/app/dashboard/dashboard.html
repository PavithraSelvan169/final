    <h2 class="title">The Rise of Agentic AI</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>What are AI Agents?</strong><br>
      AI agents are programs or platforms that possess high autonomy and agency,
      enabling them to make decisions and act to achieve specific goals, often
      with reduced human intervention. Unlike traditional AI, which typically
      functions as a tool for narrow tasks, agentic AI systems evolve into team
      members by managing and executing end-to-end processes. These agents utilize
      advanced reasoning models to break down complex goals, find solutions, and
      continuously learn and adapt.

      <br><br><strong>Adoption is rising fast! </strong><br>

      Agentic AI represents a rapidly emerging technological trend expected to
      reshape enterprise efficiency and growth. This technology is projected to
      generate up to <strong>$450 billion</strong> in economic value across
      surveyed countries by 2028 through revenue uplift and cost savings.
      Adoption momentum is clearly strong: <strong>93%</strong> of leaders
      believe that successfully scaling AI agents in the next 12 months will
      provide a competitive advantage. Currently, <strong>14%</strong> of
      organizations have implemented AI agents at partial or full scale, with
      another <strong>23%</strong> running pilot projects.

      <br><br><strong>Some Challenges </strong><br>

      However, organizations face significant challenges that limit the
      deployment of highly autonomous systems. Trust in fully autonomous AI
      agents is declining, with only <strong>27%</strong> of organizations
      expressing confidence, a drop from <strong>43%</strong> twelve months
      ago. Concerns are widespread regarding ethical and safety risks, such as
      data privacy and algorithmic bias. Furthermore, over
      <strong>80%</strong> of organizations lack mature AI infrastructure, and
      fewer than one in five report high levels of data readiness, which
      significantly impedes the ability to scale agentic systems effectively.

    <li>Web Server: Nginx</li>
    <li>Back-End Port Number: 3000</li>
    <li>Front-End Port Number: 80</li>
    <li>Database Used: MySQL, hosted in Amazon Aurora RDS</li>

  </p>
  <h3>Application</h3>
  <p><strong>Back-End</strong><br>API is developed using Python and hosted on AWS EC2 instance.
    <br>
    <li>Python Package for REST API: FastAPI</li>
    <li>Hosted using nohup and uvicorn packages</li>
    <br>
    <strong>Front-End</strong><br>The front-end is developed using Angular 21 and served using nginx on AWS EC2
    instance.
  </p>

  <h3>Features Implemented</h3>
<p>The following features are implemented in the application:
  <br>
  <li>Single Page Application using Angular UI, Python API and MySQL Database </li>
  <li>Login Page</li>
  <li>Dashboard (homepage) with Insights on Rise of AI Agents and Technical Details</li>
  <li>Summary Page with 2 charts</li>
  <li>Report Page with a multi-chart view</li>
  <li>Login and Logout Functionalities using JWT Tokens</li>
  <li>Code check-in excludes build-related files using gitignore</li>
  <strong>Additional work:</strong>
  <li>3-tier Service Oriented Architecture design is implemented</li>
  <li>AuthGuard, LoginGuard, a common AuthService, etc. are implemented to comply with proper Angular design.</li>
  <li>Favicon is implemented</li>
  <li>User's password is hashed while signing up (only API endpoint, no UI). Hashed password is verified during Login process.</li>
