      <p class="explanation-text">The predictions indicate a significant shift towards higher levels of autonomy in AI agents over the next
      few years. In the next 12 months, a majority of processes are expected to remain at Levels 0 to 2, with only
      15% reaching Level 3 or higher. However, within 1 to 3 years, there is a marked increase in maturity, with
      45% of processes anticipated to operate at Level 3 or above. This trend underscores the growing confidence
      and reliance on AI agents to handle more complex tasks with reduced human intervention.
